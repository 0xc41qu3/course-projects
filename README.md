# Course Projects Repository

Welcome to my Course Projects Repository! üöÄ

## Overview

This repository is a collection of projects I've developed for various courses. As a passionate front-end engineer, I enjoy applying my programming skills to real-world scenarios. Each course has its own dedicated directory containing the project work I've done.

## Courses and Projects

Here's a list of the courses I've completed and the corresponding projects:

1. [**Cryptography**](https://github.com/0xc41qu3/alura/tree/main/cryptography)
2. [**Functional approach using JavaScript**](https://github.com/0xc41qu3/alura/tree/main/js_using_a_functional_approach)

Feel free to explore each project's directory to learn more about the specific technologies and concepts I've applied.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in running or contributing to any of these projects, please follow the setup instructions in each project's README file.

## Feedback and Contributions

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions. If you have any ideas for improving these projects or want to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out.
